;;; Commentary:

;; `helm-taskswitch' provides an X window and buffer switching with helm.

;; ## Installation

;; Install wmctrl and helm.

;; ## Usage

;; To activate use `M-x helm-task-switcher'.

;; ## Issues / bugs

;; If you discover an issue or bug in `helm-taskswitch' not already noted:

;; * as a TODO item, or

;; please create a new issue with as much detail as possible, including:

;; * which version of Emacs you're running on which operating system, and

;; * how you installed `helm-task-switcher', wmctrl and helm.

;; ## TODOs

;; * Track or get with focus history and use it to order candidates.
;; There is a strat on this commented out at the bottom.  The current
;; order is arbitrary.

;; Intersting blog post about alt-tab, suggests markov model
;; http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/solving-the-alt-tab-problem/
;; Ideas from that: other hot key for "go back to most recent window"

;; * Keep Emacs out of focust history
;; Filter Emacs out of focus history when it is used for switching.

;; * Dedup WMCLASS
;; WMCLASS is often program.Program, transform theses to just Program

;; * Strip WMCLASS from end of title
;; Title often ends with WMCLASS or something like that.  Try to strip these off.
